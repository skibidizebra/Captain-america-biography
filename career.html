    <h2>Career and Achievements</h2>
    <p>Captain America's career is defined by his unwavering commitment to justice and freedom.
        After being transformed into a super soldier during World War II, Steve became a key figure in defeating Hydra and the Red Skull, which symbolized hope and bravery.
        Even though he was frozen in ice and thought to be dead, Steve was later brought back to life and became the leader of the Avengers, guiding them through countless battles.
        His tactical brilliance and moral compass were crucial in defeating threats like Ultron and Thanos, especially during the Infinity War and Endgame.
        Captain America also stood firm during the Civil War, opposing the Superhero Registration Act to protect individual freedoms.</p>

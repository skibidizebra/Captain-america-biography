    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <p>Despite these hardships, Steve developed a strong sense of justice, determination, and a deep desire to help others.
        From a young age, Steve was physically weak and frail, often being bullied by other children.
        However, he was never discouraged by his physical limitations.
         Instead, he focused on developing his intelligence, resourcefulness, and unshakable will.
    <h3> Army </h3>
        His passion for serving his country grew during the rise of Nazi Germany and the global tensions of the 1930s and early 1940s.
        Steve wanted nothing more than to enlist in the U.S. Army and fight in World War II, but his weak physique made him unfit for service.
        Despite numerous rejections, Steveâ€™s courage and desire to protect his country caught the attention of Dr. Abraham Erskine, a scientist leading the U.S. Army's Super Soldier Program.

    <h3>How Steve Rogers turned into a Superhero</h3>
         Seeing the potential in Steve's character, Erskine chose him to be the subject of the experiment that would transform him into the super-soldier Captain America.
        Through the experiment, Steve's physical strength, endurance, and agility were upgraded to the peak of human potential, giving him the superhuman abilities that would allow him to fight for justice on the front lines of the war.
        Steve Rogers' early life shaped his character and made him the man who would become the symbol of courage, sacrifice, and freedom that we know as Captain America.

    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p>Captain America's personal life is about sacrifice, love, and the challenge of living in a world that changed without him.
        Steve Rogers' deep connection to Peggy Carter, his one true love, remained in his heart, even after being frozen in ice for decades.
        His friendship with Bucky Barnes, his childhood companion, was tested when Bucky was turned into the Winter Soldier, but Steve's unwavering loyalty never faltered.
        As a "man out of time," Steve struggled to adjust to the modern world, often feeling disconnected from the society around him.
        Despite this, he remained grounded in his moral values and sense of duty, even when faced with personal loss and the burden of leadership.
        After stepping away from the mantle of Captain America, Steve found peace in moments of reflection, though the world often called him back.
        Ultimately, Steve Rogers' personal life reveals a hero who sought connection and understanding, even as he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders.
